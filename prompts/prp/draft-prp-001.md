Create a rough draft PRP for initial review: $ARGUMENTS

**Purpose**: Quick requirements capture for "$ARGUMENTS"

**Process**: This is a lightweight first pass focusing on functionality and context without running extensive validation checks.

**Output**: Draft PRP files saved to `./prp/drafts/` ready for review and subsequent external steps to be brought to completion.

## Process

This command quickly drafts a PRP focusing on:
- Core functionality description
- Basic requirements gathering
- Initial context and scope
- High-level security/privacy considerations
- Accessibility and inclusion needs
- Life-critical development considerations (when applicable)
- Task decomposition and breakdown for complex features
- Preventing scope creep early

### Implementation Steps

1. **Create Draft**: Generate draft PRP following the template below
4. **Generate Report**:
	 - Next steps for user


## Life-Critical Standards Consideration

When drafting PRPs, consider if the feature involves:
- **Critical Systems**: Life-safety, security, or financial impact
- **Sensitive Data**: PII, PHI, financial, or confidential information
- **High Availability**: Systems requiring 99.9%+ uptime
- **Regulatory Compliance**: GDPR, HIPAA, SOX, PCI DSS requirements
- **Accessibility and Inclusion**: Features impacting diverse user needs

If YES to any above, the draft must include:
- **NIST Framework Applicability**: Which standards may apply (FIPS Excluded)
- **Emergency Stop Triggers**: What could halt development
- **Quality Gate Requirements**: Which validation checkpoints needed
- **Compliance Implications**: Regulatory requirements to consider 

**Note**: This is NOT the final PRP. It is a draft task list for review and refinement before running subsequent steps for full validation and completion.

## Task Decomposition and Agent Coordination

Leverage @Project Manager, @Architect and other agents as needed to **break down and define tasks** - NOT to solve them (solving happens in subsequent steps).

**Decomposition Process**:
- Break down complex features into smaller objectives and finally individual single tasks
- Each task should be atomic and independently testable and deliverable
- Include all clarifying questions in the draft for user responses
- **Formula**: Complex Feature → N Objectives → N Tasks → N PRPs → N Commits → Complete Feature (merged to main, all tests passing)
- **Preventing Scope Creep**: Strategies to maintain focus and avoid feature bloat
- **Testability**: Ensure each task has clear and testable acceptance criteria
- **User Story Mapping**: Align tasks with user stories for clarity

**Size and Scope Guidelines**:
- Each task PRP must be focused and concise, target single responsibility
- All template sections must be completed (not optional - see template below)
- Be concise but complete in each section using bullet points over paragraphs

## Workflow

Step 001 — Panel Decomposition (TASK001)

What you should do:
- Read the feature description: "$ARGUMENTS".
- Produce an initial task decomposition using the TARGET JSON TEMPLATE for TASK001.
- Keep tasks atomic: single objective, ≤2 affected components, ≤1 dependency (prefer 0).
- Provide clear, testable acceptance criteria for each task (3–5 bullets).
- Include clarifying questions where needed; do not implement solutions.
- Return JSON only (no prose outside JSON). Follow the exact key names and structure.

Agent usage and delegation suggestions:
- Only suggest or delegate to agents that exist in the provided Agent Catalog (JSON) included in system context.
- Use the exact agent id values from available_agents[].id when adding delegation_suggestions.
- Reference repository: local Claude Agents registry at ~/.claude/agents (plus any paths in CLAUDE_AGENT_DIRS). Each agent’s .md defines its system role.

Determinism and structure:
- Do not add or remove keys from the template; preserve order and nesting.
- Do not invent agent names. If an appropriate agent is not listed, omit it.
- Keep language concise and consistent to support stable caching across runs.


## Example Usage

```
/draft-prp "Implement two-factor authentication for admin users"
```

Creates a draft covering:
- Basic 2FA flow
- Admin user context
- Initial security needs
- Questions about SMS vs TOTP
- Scope boundaries

## Benefits

- **Fast**: Get initial requirements documented quickly
- **Iterative**: Refine before full analysis
- **Collaborative**: Review points built in
- **Efficient**: Avoid rework by clarifying early

Remember: This is step 1 of many in your PRP process. Always review and refine before proceeding.


### Best Practices
- **Single Responsibility**: Each PRP should address one focused feature or fix
- **Clear Description**: Use descriptive hyphenated names that explain the feature
- **Sequential Numbering**: Use next available number in sequence
- **Letter Variants**: Use 'a' for first attempt, 'b' for revision if needed

**Note**: Keep PRPs focused and single-purpose. Complex features can be broken into multiple sequential PRPs rather than trying to handle everything in one. The system will automatically handle splitting during generation.
