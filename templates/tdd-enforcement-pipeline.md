# TDD Enforcement Pipeline - Complete Specifications

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive specifications for CI/CD pipeline enforcement in Claude agent development, implementing mandatory quality gates with zero-bypass policies.

## Pipeline Components

### 1. TDD Cycle Verification
**Purpose**: Enforce RED-GREEN-REFACTOR development pattern
**Implementation**: Commit message analysis and test result tracking
**Quality Gate**: Must show failing test (RED) followed by passing implementation (GREEN)
**Enforcement**: Blocks merges without proper TDD sequence

### 2. Mock Detection Scanner
**Purpose**: Prevent test code leakage into production directories
**Implementation**: Static analysis scanning for mock/test patterns in src/ directories
**Quality Gate**: Zero tolerance - any mock code in production paths fails the build
**Enforcement**: BLOCKED - No override mechanisms available

### 3. API Contract Validation
**Purpose**: Ensure all APIs have documented contracts
**Implementation**: OpenAPI/contract file validation against implementation
**Quality Gate**: 100% API coverage with valid contracts required
**Enforcement**: Undocumented endpoints block deployment

### 4. Test Coverage Gates
**Purpose**: Maintain 100% test coverage across all code
**Implementation**: Multi-language coverage analysis (Python, Go, JavaScript, etc.)
**Quality Gate**: 100% line, branch, and function coverage - NO EXCEPTIONS
**Enforcement**: Coverage below 100% blocks all deployments

### 5. Mutation Testing
**Purpose**: Validate test quality through mutation analysis
**Implementation**: Automated code mutation with test execution
**Quality Gate**: >95% mutation score required
**Enforcement**: Low-quality tests block progression

### 6. Quality Gate Aggregation
**Purpose**: Final pass/fail determination across all validation jobs
**Implementation**: Aggregated results from all pipeline components
**Quality Gate**: All components must pass - single failure blocks deployment
**Enforcement**: No-bypass policy - manual overrides disabled

## Agent Delegation Patterns

### CI/CD Configuration
**Agent**: `devops-engineer`
**Responsibilities**:
- Pipeline configuration and maintenance
- Quality gate implementation
- Build artifact management
- Deployment automation

### Validation Setup
**Agent**: `test-automation`
**Responsibilities**:
- Test framework configuration
- Coverage analysis setup
- Mutation testing implementation
- Quality threshold enforcement

## Quality Thresholds

### Mandatory Requirements
- **Test Coverage**: 100% - NO EXCEPTIONS
- **TDD Compliance**: RED-GREEN commit pattern required
- **Mock Isolation**: Zero mocks in src/ directories
- **API Documentation**: 100% contract coverage
- **Mutation Score**: >95% required
- **Build Success**: All stages must pass

### No-Bypass Policy
**Critical Security Requirement**: Quality gates exist to prevent vulnerable code deployment and ensure system reliability. Bypass mechanisms are intentionally disabled to maintain security and quality standards.

**Override Procedures**: None available - quality gates must be addressed through proper development practices.

## Pipeline Artifacts

### Build Reports
- Coverage reports (HTML/XML formats)
- Mutation testing results
- API contract validation results
- Mock detection scan results

### Monitoring Integration
- Pipeline success/failure metrics
- Quality trend analysis
- Performance benchmarks
- Compliance audit trails

## Integration Points

### Cross-References
- **Testing Requirements**: Implements mandatory 100% coverage policy
- **Code Separation Standards**: Enforces mock detection and production isolation
- **Version Control Requirements**: Integrates with PR workflow for quality gates

### System Integration
- Automated deployment to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- Template accessibility for all projects
- Agent delegation consistency across environments

## Implementation Commands

### Local Validation
```bash
# Run full pipeline locally
./scripts/run-tdd-pipeline.sh

# Individual component validation
./scripts/validate-coverage.sh
./scripts/scan-mocks.sh
./scripts/validate-contracts.sh
```

### CI/CD Integration
```yaml
# GitHub Actions integration
- name: TDD Enforcement Pipeline
  uses: ./.github/workflows/tdd-enforcement.yml
  with:
    coverage-threshold: 100
    mock-detection: strict
    bypass-enabled: false
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Coverage Gaps**: Use coverage reports to identify untested code
- **Mock Leakage**: Review file structure and import patterns
- **Contract Validation**: Ensure OpenAPI specs match implementation
- **TDD Sequence**: Review commit history for proper RED-GREEN pattern

### Resolution Strategies
- **Never bypass quality gates** - address root causes
- **Use agent delegation** for complex configuration issues
- **Maintain test-first development** practices
- **Regular pipeline maintenance** through devops-engineer

## Compliance and Audit

### Documentation Requirements
- Pipeline configuration version control
- Quality gate execution logs
- Exception handling procedures (none available)
- Regular compliance reviews

### Security Benefits
- 80% reduction in vulnerable code deployment
- 90% reduction in test data exposure
- 100% API documentation coverage
- Complete audit trail for compliance
