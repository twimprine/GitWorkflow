# Execute-PRP Template

## Multi-Agent Orchestration Framework

### Phase 1: Project Coordination
- **Agent**: project-manager
- **Tasks**: Parse PRP requirements, validate user stories against `docs/USER_STORIES.md` framework, coordinate workflow, manage quality gates
- **User Story Validation**:
  - Verify all required stakeholder perspectives are addressed
  - Confirm acceptance criteria are testable and measurable
  - Ensure story categories cover functional, security, operational, and compliance needs
- **Deliverables**: Execution plan, agent assignments, timeline, validated user story matrix with all perspectives

### Phase 2: Architecture Review
- **Agent**: architect-reviewer
- **Tasks**: Validate system design, integration patterns, scalability
- **Deliverables**: Architecture validation, design recommendations

### Phase 3: Security Assessment
- **Agent**: security-reviewer
- **Tasks**: Security review, threat assessment, compliance validation
- **Deliverables**: Security clearance, vulnerability assessment

### Phase 4: Technology Implementation
- **Agent**: [Technology-specific] (python-developer, nodejs-developer, etc.)
- **Tasks**: TDD implementation, code quality, best practices
- **Deliverables**: Production code with 100% test coverage

### Phase 5: Test Automation
- **Agent**: test-automation
- **Tasks**: Comprehensive testing, coverage validation, performance testing
- **Deliverables**: Test reports, coverage metrics, performance benchmarks

### Phase 6: Performance Profiling
- **Agent**: performance-profiler
- **Tasks**: Performance analysis, optimization, benchmarking
- **Deliverables**: Performance reports, optimization recommendations

### Phase 7: Documentation
- **Agent**: documentation-writer
- **Tasks**: Technical documentation, user guides, API docs
- **Deliverables**: Complete documentation suite

### Phase 8: Deployment Management
- **Agent**: deployment-manager
- **Tasks**: Feature branch, pull request creation, integration
- **Deliverables**: Pull request with complete implementation

## Quality Gates
- Security validation required before implementation
- 100% test coverage mandatory
- Performance benchmarks must be met
- Documentation must be comprehensive
- Pull request must be created with complete implementation

## Success Criteria
- All agents complete their phases successfully
- All quality gates pass validation
- Pull request created and ready for review
- PRP archived with completion summary
