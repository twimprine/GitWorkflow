# ARM64-First CI/CD Architecture

## Overview

This document describes the enterprise-grade CI/CD pipeline implementation for AWS Kubernetes infrastructure using ARM64-first architecture with GitHub Actions Runner Controller (ARC).

## Architecture Principles

### ARM64-First Strategy

**Primary Architecture**: ARM64-native execution on AWS Graviton instances
**Fallback Strategy**: Containerized x64 tools when ARM64 binaries unavailable
**Performance Target**: 40-60% improvement over traditional x64 runners
**Cost Target**: 70-80% reduction in runner costs

### Multi-Architecture Tool Matrix

```yaml
ARM64 Native Tools (Preferred):
  - Terraform (HashiCorp ARM64 builds)
  - Go/Terratest (native ARM64 compilation)
  - kubectl (ARM64 binary)
  - Helm (ARM64 binary)
  - AWS CLI (ARM64 Python/binary)
  - TFLint (ARM64 native)
  - tfsec (Go binary for ARM64)

ARM64 Containerized Tools:
  - Checkov (Python container, multi-arch)
  - Semgrep (Python container, multi-arch)
  - Trivy (multi-arch container)
  - Syft (SBOM generation, multi-arch)
  - Cosign (signature verification, multi-arch)

x64 Fallback (Only if Required):
  - Legacy compliance scanners
  - Specialized security tools without ARM64 support
```

## Components

### 1. GitHub Actions Runner Controller (ARC)

**Implementation**: Kubernetes-native auto-scaling runner management

**Security Features**:
- Pod Security Standards: Restricted mode enforcement
- Network Policies: Egress-only to GitHub and AWS APIs
- Resource Quotas: Prevent resource exhaustion
- Ephemeral Runners: Automatic cleanup after each job
- Non-root Execution: All containers run as non-root users

**Scalability**:
- Min Runners: 2 (always available)
- Max Runners: 20 (auto-scale based on queue depth)
- Target Architecture: ARM64 Graviton instances
- Spot Instance Integration: Cost-optimized scaling

**Resource Allocation**:
```yaml
Requests:
  CPU: 2 cores
  Memory: 4Gi

Limits:
  CPU: 8 cores
  Memory: 16Gi
```

### 2. Validation Pipeline

**Terraform Validation**:
- Format Check: `terraform fmt -check -recursive`
- Initialization: `terraform init -backend=false`
- Validation: `terraform validate`
- Linting: `tflint --recursive`

**Security Scanning** (Multi-Layer):
1. **Checkov**: Infrastructure as Code security scanning
   - NIST 800-53 control validation
   - CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark
   - Custom policy enforcement

2. **tfsec**: Terraform-specific security analysis
   - SARIF output for GitHub Security integration
   - ARM64 native binary execution

3. **Semgrep**: Pattern-based security analysis
   - Custom rule support
   - Supply chain security checks

### 3. SLSA Build Attestation

**Supply Chain Security**:
- SBOM Generation: Syft for Software Bill of Materials
- Signature Verification: Cosign keyless signing
- Provenance: Build attestation for all artifacts
- Compliance: SLSA Level 3 requirements

**Artifacts**:
- `sbom.spdx.json`: Complete dependency inventory
- `sbom.bundle`: Cryptographic signature bundle
- Stored in GitHub Actions artifacts for audit trail

### 4. NIST 800-53 Compliance Engine

**Automated Control Validation**:
```yaml
Access Control (AC):
  - AC-2: Account Management (GitHub RBAC)
  - AC-3: Access Enforcement (Approval gates)
  - AC-6: Least Privilege (Minimal IAM roles)

Audit and Accountability (AU):
  - AU-2: Event Logging (All pipeline events)
  - AU-3: Audit Record Content (Structured logging)
  - AU-12: Audit Generation (Automated collection)

Configuration Management (CM):
  - CM-2: Baseline Configuration (Terraform state)
  - CM-3: Configuration Change Control (PR process)
  - CM-8: Component Inventory (SBOM generation)

System and Communications Protection (SC):
  - SC-8: Transmission Confidentiality (TLS/mTLS)
  - SC-13: Cryptographic Protection (Cosign signatures)
  - SC-28: Protection at Rest (Encrypted state files)
```

**Compliance Reporting**:
- Real-time compliance scoring
- Automated evidence collection
- Exception tracking and management
- Regulatory reporting templates

## Security Architecture

### Zero-Trust Network Model

**Network Segmentation**:
- Dedicated namespace: `github-actions-runner`
- Network policies: Egress-only to required endpoints
- DNS resolution: Restricted to kube-dns only
- HTTPS enforcement: All external communications encrypted

**Pod Security**:
- Security Context: Non-root, read-only root filesystem where possible
- Seccomp Profile: RuntimeDefault for syscall filtering
- Capabilities: Drop ALL unnecessary Linux capabilities
- AppArmor/SELinux: Enforced profile for additional protection

### Secret Management

**OIDC Keyless Authentication**:
- No long-lived credentials stored
- GitHub OIDC provider integration
- AWS IAM role assumption with web identity
- Short-lived tokens (15-minute expiry)

**AWS Secrets Manager Integration**:
- Centralized secret storage
- Automatic rotation support
- Audit logging for all access
- Encryption at rest with AWS KMS

### Threat Protection

**STRIDE Mitigation**:
```yaml
Spoofing:
  - Mitigation: OIDC authentication, no static credentials
  - Control: IA-2 (Identification and Authentication)

Tampering:
  - Mitigation: Signed commits, branch protection
  - Control: CM-3 (Configuration Change Control)

Repudiation:
  - Mitigation: Comprehensive audit logging
  - Control: AU-2 (Audit Events)

Information Disclosure:
  - Mitigation: Secret scanning, encrypted state
  - Control: SC-28 (Protection of Information at Rest)

Denial of Service:
  - Mitigation: Auto-scaling, circuit breakers
  - Control: SC-5 (Denial of Service Protection)

Elevation of Privilege:
  - Mitigation: Least privilege IAM, RBAC
  - Control: AC-6 (Least Privilege)
```

## Performance Optimization

### ARM64 Compiler Optimizations

**Native Binary Compilation**:
- Go modules: Native ARM64 compilation with `-march=armv8-a+crypto`
- Terraform providers: ARM64 provider caching
- Docker layers: ARM64 multi-stage builds with layer caching

### Caching Strategy

**Multi-Layer Caching**:
1. **Terraform Provider Cache**: Shared volume for provider binaries
2. **Docker Layer Cache**: BuildKit with ARM64-specific layers
3. **Go Module Cache**: Shared Go mod cache for Terratest
4. **Dependency Cache**: NPM, pip, gem caches as needed

### Parallel Execution

**Matrix Builds**:
- Independent validation jobs run in parallel
- Security scans execute concurrently
- Intelligent job distribution across runners
- Resource-aware scheduling to prevent contention

## Cost Optimization

### Annual Cost Comparison

```yaml
Traditional (GitHub-Hosted x64):
  - Monthly Cost: $160/month
  - Annual Cost: $1,920/year
  - Performance: Baseline

ARM64 Self-Hosted:
  - Monthly Cost: $30-50/month (spot instances)
  - Annual Cost: $360-600/year
  - Performance: 40-60% faster
  - Savings: $1,320-1,560/year (70-80% reduction)
```

### Spot Instance Integration

**Cost-Optimized Scaling**:
- Primary runners on Graviton spot instances
- Fallback to on-demand if spot unavailable
- Intelligent spot instance selection (lowest price)
- Graceful handling of spot interruptions

## Monitoring & Observability

### Service Level Indicators (SLIs)

```yaml
Pipeline Availability: 99.9% uptime target
Pipeline Success Rate: 99% for valid changes
Mean Time to Deploy: < 30 minutes
Mean Time to Detect: < 5 minutes for failures
Mean Time to Recover: < 15 minutes
Security Scan Duration: < 10 minutes
```

### Metrics Collection

**Golden Signals**:
1. **Latency**: Pipeline execution time (p50, p95, p99)
2. **Traffic**: Pipeline executions per hour
3. **Errors**: Failure rate and error classification
4. **Saturation**: Runner utilization and queue depth

**Custom Metrics**:
- Security scan results and vulnerability counts
- Compliance score trends over time
- Cost per pipeline execution
- ARM64 vs x64 performance comparison

### Alerting

**Alert Levels**:
```yaml
Critical (P1):
  - Pipeline complete failure
  - Security breach detected
  - Response: 15 minutes, PagerDuty

High (P2):
  - Performance degradation > 50%
  - Security scan failures
  - Response: 1 hour, Slack

Medium (P3):
  - Minor failures or warnings
  - Performance issues < 50%
  - Response: 4 hours, Ticket
```

## Deployment Strategy

### Multi-Environment Workflow

```yaml
Development:
  - Target: Raspberry Pi ARM64 cluster
  - Trigger: All PR commits
  - Approval: None (automated)
  - Rollback: Automatic on failure

Staging:
